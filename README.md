This repository contains end-to-end data science and machine learning projects developed during my M.Tech at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. It covers problem formulation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, statistical hypothesis testing, and model development across classification, regression, clustering, and time series forecasting tasks. Projects include credit risk modeling, customer segmentation using RFM and clustering, stock price forecasting with LSTM, and CNN-based image classification. The work leverages Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, StatsModels, and TensorFlow, with a strong focus on model evaluation, interpretability, and real-world applicability in finance, analytics, and predictive systems.
